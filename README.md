Simple zig window manager to write my own from scratch without XCB or XLib

todo:
- implement teardown logic of the connection

most of the stuff in src/x11 has been copied directly from the Xorg manual (R7.7)

and the juicebox implementation of a window manager, a lot of inspiration came from there, though the code is (relatively) old so this is an updated version
